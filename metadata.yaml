description: "The Tale of Tom Kitten is a children's book, written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter. It was released by Frederick Warne & Co. in September 1907.\
  \ The tale is about manners and how children react to them. Tabitha Twitchit, a\
  \ cat, invites friends for tea. She washes and dresses her three kittens for the\
  \ party, but within moments the kittens have soiled and lost their clothes while\
  \ scampering about the garden. Tabitha is \"affronted\". She sends the kittens to\
  \ bed, and tells her friends the kittens have the measles. Once the tea party is\
  \ underway however, its \"dignity and repose\" are disturbed by the kittens romping\
  \ overhead and leaving a bedroom in disorder.\nPotter's career as a children's author\
  \ and illustrator was launched in 1902 with the release of The Tale of Peter Rabbit.\
  \ She continued to publish, and, in 1905, bought Hill Top, a farm in Cumbria, with\
  \ the sales profits from her books and a small legacy from an aunt. Her tales then\
  \ took inspiration from the farm, its woodland surroundings, and nearby villages.\
  \ Work began on Tom Kitten in 1906 and its setting became the Hill Top farmhouse.\
  \ Illustrations depict the interior of the house and the gardens, paths, and gate\
  \ at the front of the house.\nTwenty thousand copies of the book were released in\
  \ September 1907 and another 12,500 the following December. Potter composed a few\
  \ miniature letters for child friends as if from the characters in the tale, and,\
  \ in 1917, she released a painting book under Tom Kitten's name. In 1935, two books\
  \ of piano pieces and piano duets for children were published with one piece inspired\
  \ by Tom Kitten and another by the Puddle-Ducks. Tom and other characters in the\
  \ book have become the subjects of a variety of merchandise over the years including\
  \ porcelain figurines and plush toys. The tale is still in print, and has been translated\
  \ and published in several languages.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
